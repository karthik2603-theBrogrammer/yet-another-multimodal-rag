Complications include strictures (most common), perforation, fistulas, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, decades later).  Management focuses on airway support, fluids, pain control, and avoiding interventions like NG tubes that could worsen injury.\\n', 'Zargar grades classify esophageal injury severity.  Higher grades indicate increasing damage, from no visible damage (0) to perforation (4).  Management escalates with severity, from pain control and diet modification to surgery. Sequelae range from none to strictures and necrosis.\\n', \"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis differ significantly in genetic predisposition, age of onset, symptoms, disease location, and treatment response. Crohn's is associated with NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations, more frequent pain, right-sided inflammation, fistulization, and responds to TPN/bowel rest. Ulcerative colitis involves different genetic markers, presents with bloody stool, left-sided inflammation, and is less responsive to TPN/bowel rest.  Crohn's has a higher prevalence of perianal complications and transmural inflammation, while ulcerative colitis carries a greater malignancy risk.\\n\", \"This table compares key features of Celiac Disease, Tropical Sprue, and Whipple's Disease.  Celiac Disease, affecting 1% of the population and more common in females, is caused by an immune reaction to gluten.  Tropical Sprue, typically affecting adults, is linked to post-infectious malabsorption and bacterial/mycotoxin involvement. Whipple's Disease, a rare condition predominantly affecting older white males, is caused by the bacterium *Tropheryma whipplei*.  The diseases differ in their symptoms, with Celiac Disease often asymptomatic but potentially causing diarrhea and steatorrhea, Tropical Sprue characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea, and Whipple's Disease presenting with abdominal pain, weight loss, low-grade fever, and potentially dementia.
